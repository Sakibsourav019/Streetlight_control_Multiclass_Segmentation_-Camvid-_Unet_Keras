# Streetlight_control_Multiclass_Segmentation_-Camvid-_Unet_Keras
We trained the U-net model based with ResNet-34 as backbone to accomplish the tasks. The validity of the models is ensured through corresponding evaluation matrices. The proposed model is much simpler, cost effective, durable and robust than the conventional, physical sensor-based existing intelligent solutions.
